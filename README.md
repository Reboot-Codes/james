## Archetexture

JAMES is built on a few components and can act as a distributed computing network. It's structured similar to a meta-interpretation of how a person's brain works. `nexus` is the centralized method to which systems communicate with eachother.

The core of JAMES is the KRR, and therefore, its knowledge graph. The knowledge graph is a database of all data JAMES has been exposed to. Multiple copies of this can be made and can be used to restore an instance of JAMES.
